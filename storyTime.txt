About the Life and Travels of Pierre the Pear 

Once upon a time, there was a pear named Pierre, and he felt lonely and wanted to explore the world and meet new people.

So Pierre decided to go on a backpacking trip in California with his best friend Timothy the Turnip the Third. Pierre was so excited to meet new people on this trip.
